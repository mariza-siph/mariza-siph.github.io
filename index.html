				<h2> Daily Routine </h2>
				<p> I wake up at the crack of dawn (same time as my neighbour the donkey) then I demand to go on my morning walk so i can run around in the empty fields and ensure i make my everlasting ear infection worse. once that is done i go home, bark at cats to ensure the house is protected. Following these busy morning activities, depending on the weather, i take a nap either by the fire place or at my spot over the stairs where i have a birds eye view of the house. Once I'm well rested I ensure that all my humans are made aware of my existance and give me the correct amount of pets. When i get the right amount of pets, I get served my dinner, go on a liesurely walk and return home to get a full nights sleep (unless of course I sense a cat in the garden)</p>

				<h2> Origin Story </h2>
				<p> As a puppy, 3 months old, on June 15th 2009, i was gifted to my owners. They were only 6 and 2. Having been born on April 23rd 2009, i was tiny, giving my dad the oppurtunity to lift me like baby simba, therefore i was named after the famous lion king, Simba, it's better than simply king... like the little one had recommended initially. </p>
